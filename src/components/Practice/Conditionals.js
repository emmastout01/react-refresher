/* Note: 'if statements' do not work when they are written in JSX. 
 Example in JSX that will not work: 
(
  <h1>
    {
      if (purchase.complete) {
        'Thank you for placing an order!'
      }
    }
  </h1>
  There are other ways to go about writing conditionals, either by writing if statements in JS and then plugging in the altered variables into JSX, or with the ternary operator.

/* Here's another nice example of the ternary operator: 
function coinToss () {
  // Randomly return either 'heads' or 'tails'.
  return Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails';

  kitty: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-kitty.jpg',
  doggy: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg'
};

const img = <img src={pics[coinToss() === 'heads' ? 'kitty' : 'doggy']} />;
